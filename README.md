# Homepage
This is a project I have been working on for a number of months. The initial idea was just to create  home page with links, a search bar and a background. Though I found that hard coding the links in made it difficult (and time consuming) to edit what links should be shown. Thus, I started creating an interface which would allow more links to be created.

Eventually, the interface became more of a full-blown CMS which offers many features. Some of the features which this home page has are:
- links
- a clock
- a background which is randomly selected on page reload
- a responsive search bar which can search different websites (such as Youtube or Google)

The CMS offers options such as:
- the option to add, remove and re-arrange links
- the option to choose a different layout for the links, by using a different CSS file
- the option to upload new backgrounds and remove old ones
- the option to change how the clock looks using CSS

This project is in no way complete! Much more work needs to be done before it is good to use.

One problem is that since this uses the back-end programming language PHP, it must be either hosted locally, or on a server. I hope to one day offer this home page CMS as part of an online package so that people can create accounts, and access their home page from anywhere in the world.

TO DO:
- fix the create a new link and edit an existing link
- fix the edit a link CSS file
- add syntax highlighing for when users edit CSS
- make the site work better with phones
